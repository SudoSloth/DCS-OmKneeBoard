# DCS-OmKneeBoard

A personal project to collect select information pertaining to the weaponry and checklists for DCS aircraft various munitions formatted for VR. The kneeboard notes I've chosen to include are not an exhaustive list of steps, but just the important steps to jog the memory because whatever I write wont be enough to beat the experience/repetition/tutorials.

To install the pages copy the "Kneeboard" folder into the directory `C:\Users\{User}\SavedGames\DCS\`. In-game, the kneeboard pages shall appear after the official mod kneeboard pages.

The images were created using [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) - the open source desktop publishing tool and exported as images in the relevant kneeboard directory for the plane.

Want to see something? Let me know.

If you use it, I hope you like it. If you love it then help out - download the software, download the source, copy and paste a template and have a go at making one. The general styles are in the Scribus files.

Road Map:
* ~FA/18 Hornet Weapon list~
* ~SU25T Frogfoot Weapon list~
* ~AJS37 Viggen Weapon list~
